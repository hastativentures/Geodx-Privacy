## Introduction

GeoDX (“we,” “our,” or “us”) is owned and operated by **Hastati Ventures LLC**, located in Scottsdale, Arizona, USA. Your privacy is critically important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how GeoDX collects, uses, stores, and protects your information when you use our mobile application (the “App”).

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:

- Provide and maintain the GeoDX application  
- Enable you to organize and visualize your contacts geographically  
- Infer geographic locations based on phone number area codes  
- Prevent duplicate contact entries during import  
- Process and manage your subscription  
- Improve and optimize the application  
- Provide customer support

## 3. Data Storage & Security

### 3.1 Local Storage

GeoDX stores your data locally on your device using AsyncStorage, a secure, asynchronous, persistent key-value storage system. This means:

- Your contact data remains on your device  
- Data is not transmitted to external servers without your explicit consent  
- Your data is protected by your device's security features (passcode, Face ID, Touch ID)  
- Uninstalling the app will permanently delete all locally stored data  

### 3.2 Why We Use Local Storage

We chose local storage to maximize your privacy and data security. Unlike cloud-based solutions:

- Your data is never stored on our servers  
- You maintain complete ownership and control of your information  
- There is no risk of data breaches from our systems  
- The app works offline with full functionality  

### 3.3 Data Backup

Your GeoDX data may be included in your device's iCloud or local backups if you have enabled these features. Please review your device's backup settings to understand how your data is being stored and protected.

## 4. Contact Access Permission

### 4.1 Why We Need Access

GeoDX requests access to your device's contacts to provide its core functionality. This permission allows us to:

- Import your existing contacts into the GeoDX database  
- Infer geographic locations based on phone number area codes  
- Enable you to organize and visualize your network geographically  
- Prevent duplicate contact entries  

### 4.2 Permission Control

You have full control over this permission:

- You can deny the permission and still use the app with manually entered contacts  
- You can revoke access at any time through your device's Settings  
- We only read contact data; we never modify your device's address book  

### 4.3 Data Processing

When you import contacts, we process phone numbers to infer geographic location based on area codes. This processing happens entirely on your device and no data is sent to external services for this purpose.

## 5. Third-Party Services

### 5.1 RevenueCat

We use **RevenueCat** to manage subscriptions and in-app purchases. RevenueCat may collect:

- Anonymous user identifiers  
- Purchase history and subscription status  
- Device information for analytics

### 5.2 Map Services

We use mapping services (such as **Apple Maps**) to display contact locations. When you use map features, your device may communicate with these services to load map tiles and geocoding data.

### 5.3 Apple Services

As an iOS application, GeoDX uses various Apple services including:

- App Store for distribution and payments  
- Apple Maps for geographic visualization  
- iCloud for device backups (if enabled by user)
